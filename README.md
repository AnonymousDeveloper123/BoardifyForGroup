# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   After navigating to the project directory, install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   Start the development server to see the project in action:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Vite development server, and you can view your app by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available to enhance the development experience:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the optimized production build in the `dist` folder, ready for deployment.

## Previewing the Production Build

After building for production, you can preview the build locally by running:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server to preview your production build.
